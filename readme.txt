Welcome to the Equinepassion Calculator!
- by pumpkinlemma, version: 13 September 2020 -

With this program you can calculate estimations for your horses' personality and conformation grades
on the english version of EquinePassion!

How to run:
- Unzip the folder (unless you want an annoying dialog to pop up every time you run the program).
- Doubleclick ep_calculator.exe.
- Follow the directions in the window just opened.

Please note:
In the current version the calculation with very good and very bad values (e.g. "very good nerves"/"very poor nerves")
does not work correctly. I will update this program once those values appear in the game.
